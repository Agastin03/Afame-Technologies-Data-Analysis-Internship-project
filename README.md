# Afame-Technologies-Data-Analysis-Internship-project
This is the Github repository to store three projects done during my Internship of 1 month at Afame Technologies as a Data Analyst Intern. These projects are Sales Data Analysis , HR Data Analysis and Titanic Survival Prediction. Thank You!

Project 1: Sales Data Analysis:

I have thoroughly analyzed our sales data using Power BI by following a systematic approach:

Defined clear objectives to identify sales trends, understand customer behavior, and optimize pricing strategies.
Imported and integrated the data using the "Get Data" feature in Power BI, combining multiple sources through Power Query Editor.
Cleaned the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats, and created necessary calculated columns.
Defined relationships between tables and created measures and calculated fields using DAX in the data modeling phase.
Used Power BI’s visualization tools for exploratory data analysis to explore the data and identify patterns.
Built interactive dashboards with charts, graphs, and tables, incorporating slicers and filters for enhanced interactivity.
Utilized Power BI’s analytics features such as forecasting and trend lines to derive insights.
I have attached the .pbix file and snapshots of the dashboards.
Project 2 : HR Data Analysis:

Using Jupyter Notebook:

1.Defined Objectives: Set clear goals to understand factors contributing to employee attrition and overall job satisfaction.

2.Data Collection: Imported the HR dataset using pandas.

3.Data Cleaning: Ensured data accuracy by checking for missing values and correcting errors.

4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted initial data exploration using summary statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots) to understand distributions and identify patterns.

5.Feature Engineering: Created new features and transformed existing ones to better suit the analysis.

6.Predictive Analysis: Used logistic regression to predict employee attrition, evaluating model performance with accuracy scores and classification reports.

5.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Power BI’s visualization tools (e.g., histograms, bar charts) to explore data and identify patterns.

6.Data Visualization: Built interactive dashboards with charts, graphs, and tables, incorporating slicers and filters for enhanced interactivity.

7.Analysis and Insights: Utilized Power BI’s analytics features to derive insights and created key performance indicators (KPIs) to track important metrics.

Project 3: Titanic Survival Prediction:

Objective: Predict survival of Titanic passengers based on available attributes.

Models Used:

Logistic Regression: Analyzed linear relationship between features and survival probability.

Decision Tree: Constructed a tree-like model to classify passengers based on feature thresholds.

Random Forest: Ensemble of decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and handle overfitting.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Classified passengers by finding optimal hyperplane separating survival classes.

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): Classified passengers based on similarity to nearest neighbors in feature space.

Approach:

Explored dataset features such as age, gender, and class.

Preprocessed data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Evaluated each model's performance using metrics like accuracy and classification reports.

Results:

Identified significant predictors of survival across models, such as gender and class.

Compared models to determine the most effective for predicting survival outcomes.

Conclusion:

Demonstrated application of multiple machine learning techniques in historical event analysis.

Discussed insights gained and potential for further improvements in predictive modeling approaches.
